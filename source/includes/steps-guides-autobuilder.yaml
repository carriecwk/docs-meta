title: Determine where the guide fits into the Index.
ref: add-guides-to-index
content: |
  The main landing page for MongoDB Guides is the `Index<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/>`__. 
  Its source code is found at `docs-tutorials/index.txt`. Writers can use the source code to determine 
  the ordered relationships between specific guides. 

  The guides listed under a `chapter::` directive are its members. The order in which they are listed is 
  the order in which they will render next to each other. 

  .. code-block:: yaml

     .. chapters::
 
        .. chapter:: Atlas
           :description: Get up and running with MongoDB Atlas.
              Learn how to create a cluster, load a sample dataset, and
              get your connection information.

title: Create a header for the guide.
ref: create-header
content: |
  Use the template below to create a header for the guide. The parts of the template that vary from one guide 
  to another are the ref anchor (`.. _guide-read--noquery:`) and the title block (`Read Data in MongoDB`).
  Replace these parts with a succinct and descriptive title and a ref anchor that appropriately reflects the title 
  for the guide you are creating. The rest should be copied identically at the top of your document. 

  .. code-block:: yaml

     :template: guide
 
     .. _guide-read-noquery:
 
     ====================
     Read Data in MongoDB  
     ====================
 
     .. default-domain:: mongodb
 
     .. contents:: On this page

title: Provide an Overview.
ref: provide-overview
content: |
  The **Overview** provides a brief description of what is to follow. The following example is from 
  the `Read Data in MongoDB<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/>`__ guide.

  The `.. short-description::` directive should be immediately followed by a one-sentence summary of the 
  task the user will learn to perform. This description will appear in the **What's Next** section of the tutorial 
  preceding your guide. The description following this description will appear at the top of your guide, immediately 
  under the **Overview** heading. The `.. time:: x` directive will be rendered as the *Time required: x minutes* recommendation 
  beneath the description.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     Overview
     --------
 
     .. short-description::
    
     Without a query, retrieve documents in MongoDB.
 
     In this guide, you will learn how to retrieve data from MongoDB.
 
     .. time:: 10

title: Inform the reader about what they will need in **What You'll Need**.
ref: state-what-the-reader-needs
content: |
  This section tells the user what procedures they will need to have completed or what resources they will need to access to 
  before they can follow along with your guide. Consider the following two examples that approach the section in different ways. 

  This example is from the `Read Data in MongoDB<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/>`__ guide. If the required steps or considerations 
  are not already concisely enumerated elsewhere in the docs, they are broken out into their own .rst file and stored in the 
  docs-tutorials/includes subdirectory.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     What You'll Need
     ----------------
 
     .. include:: /includes/prereqs_read_CRUD.rst

  This example is from the `Configure a Network Connection<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/network-connections/>`__ guide. If 
  the required steps or considerations are already enumerated elsewhere in the docs, link to them as you would in any other doc. Note that 
  in this example, the considerations are formatted as a list.

    .. code-block:: yaml

     What You'll Need
     ----------------
 
     - A MongoDB account. See :ref:`guides-create-atlas-account`.
     - An Atlas cluster. See :ref:`guides-create-a-cluster`.

title: Document the steps required to complete the tutorial in **Procedure**.
ref: document-the-steps
content: |
  This section describes the steps to follow to complete the tutorial.

  - Use the `.. procedure::` directive at the top level of the procedure, and at each level of nesting.
  - Use the `:style:` key for the following values: `normal` and `connected`.
    - `normal` marks the steps in white text on black circles.
    - `connected` is the default and is used if `:style:` is omitted. `connected` marks the steps in dark green 
      text on mint green circles, and will link the circles together with dashed lines along the margin of the text. 
      The convention is to use `normal` for the top level of a procedure, and `connected` for first-level nesting. As 
      of June 9, 2022, there will be more second-level nesting.
  - Each `.. step::` is immediately followed by its text starting on the same line.
  
  The following example is taken from the `Sign Up for a MongoDB Account<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/atlas/account/>`__ guide.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     Procedure
     ---------
 
     .. procedure::
        :style: normal
 
        .. step:: Create your MongoDB account.
 
           Go to `account.mongodb.com/account/register
           <https://account.mongodb.com/account/register>`__ to create your
           MongoDB account. To register for a new MongoDB account, you
           must do the following:
 
           .. procedure::
              :style: connected
 
              .. step:: Provide the following information about yourself:
 
                 - :guilabel:`Email Address`
                 - :guilabel:`First Name` and :guilabel:`Last Name`
                 - :guilabel:`Password`
                 - :guilabel:`Phone Number`
                 - :guilabel:`Company`
                 - :guilabel:`Job Function`
                 - :guilabel:`Country`
 
              .. step:: Review and select the checkbox to accept the :guilabel:`Privacy
                 Policy` and the :guilabel:`Terms of Service`.
 
              .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Sign up` to create the account.
 
        .. step:: Access your MongoDB services.
 
           .. procedure::
              :style: connected
 
              .. step:: Log in to your account at `account.mongodb.com/account/login
                 <https://account.mongodb.com/account/login>`__ and select
                 :guilabel:`Overview` from the left navigation menu to access the
                 MongoDB services.
 
              .. step:: Click:
 
                 - :guilabel:`Visit MongoDB Atlas` to go to MongoDB Atlas or MongoDB
                   Cloud Manager UI.
                 - :guilabel:`Visit MongoDB University` to take courses at the
                   MongoDB University.
                 - :guilabel:`Visit MongoDB Support` to get help from MongoDB Support.
 
              You can also directly log into the following MongoDB
              services using your MongoDB account credentials:
 
              - `Atlas <https://cloud.mongodb.com/account/login>`__
              - `Cloud Manager <https://cloud.mongodb.com/account/login>`__
              - `MongoDB University <https://university.mongodb.com/>`__
              - `MongoDB Support <https://support.mongodb.com/welcome>`__

  For procedures where code examples are driver-dependent, each code step gets its own .rst file include 
  that then has the standard structure for tabbed pages. Consider the following example from the 
  `Read Data in MongoDB<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/crud/read/>`__ guide.
  
  .. code-block:: yaml

     Procedure
     ---------
 
     .. tabs-selector:: drivers

     .. procedure::
     :style: normal
 
     .. step:: Connect to your MongoDB instance.

     .. include:: /includes/drivers_connect.rst
 
     In this code block there is a comment to replace the connection URI
     with your own. Make sure to replace the URI string with your
     :ref:`Atlas connection string <guides-get-connection-string>`.
 
     .. step:: Get the database and collection.
 
     Switch to the database and collection you want to query. In this case
     you will use the ``{+guides-db+}`` database and ``{+guides-coll+}``
     collection.
 
     .. include:: /includes/bind_db.rst
 
     .. step:: Retrieve all documents in the ``{+guides-coll+}`` collection.
 
 
     .. include:: /includes/find_all.rst
 
     .. step:: Iterate over the results.
 
     .. include:: /includes/iterate_all_noshellcursor.rst
 
     .. step:: Check your results.
 
     Here is the complete code followed by sample output.
 
     .. include:: /includes/crud_read_find_final_noquery.rst
 
     ..
     .. include:: /includes/drivers_close_connection.rst

title: Create a **Summary**.
ref: create-summary
content: |
  The **Summary** describes in plain text what successful completion of the guide means, and briefly describes what 
  comes next. (The description of what comes next could warrant discussing within the team, as the first item under the 
  `.. short-description::` directive for each guide already achieves this purpose.) The following example is taken 
  from the `Read Data in MongoDB<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/crud/read/>`__ guide.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     Summary
     -------
 
     If you successfully completed the procedure in this guide, you have
     retrieved data from MongoDB.
 
     In the next guide, you'll learn how to retrieve data from MongoDB using criteria.

title: Direct the reader to additional resources (optional) in **See Also**.
ref: direct-to-additional-resources
content: |
  This section provides links to other pages related to the content of the tutorial. These links may be 
  external links, links to non-guides, or links to other guides that address the same topic area. 

  The following is an example from `Read Data in MongoDB<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/guides/crud/read/>`__ guide that includes all three.

title: Create a **Footer**.
ref: create-footer
content: |
  The Footer consists of content pulled from other sources by the `.. guide-next::` directive which immediately 
  follows the **See Also** section if it exists, and the **Summary** section if not. It is separated from the preceding 
  content by one blank line, and is the last content in the document. The `.. guide-next::` directive is defined in `snooty/rstspec.toml` 
  like so:

  .. code-block:: yaml

     [directive."mongodb:guide-next"]
     help = "A section that directs users to what they should do next after reading a guide"
     example = """.. guide-next:: ${0: string}
        ${1: content}
   
  It pulls in the first element of the `.. short-description::` of the next guide in the sequence, and also shows a progress road,ap for the 
  guides chapter as a whole.
